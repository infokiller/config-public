# NOTE: rEFInd detects all the Linux kernels in the /boot directory and then
# generates a submenu boot entry for each combination of kernel and
# configuration line in the refind_linux.conf file that is in the same
# directory. In my case, it will create 4 entries in total (2 entries for each
# of the two kernels I have installed, /boot/vmlinuz-linux and
# /boot/vmlinuz-linux-hardened). In my setup, it would probably make more sense
# to have only two entries in the submenu (linux-hardened with hardened params
# and linux without the hardened params), but it seems there's no way to do it
# using the refind_linux.conf file. For more details ee:

# Parameters usage explanation:
#
# - apparmor and lsm: enable AppArmor support.
#
# - consoleblank and powersave: needed so that the monitor will enter power
#   saving when using physlock. See also:
#   https://github.com/muennich/physlock/issues/9
#
# - audit_backlog_limit: needed to avoid kmesg errors of the type "audit:
#   kauditd hold queue overflow". See also:
#   https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2017-September/msg00081.html
#
# - intel_idle.max_cstate and i915.enable_dc: attempting to mitigate freezes
#   with Intel integrated GPUs in kernels version 5.3 and 5.4. See:
#   - https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=250765
#   - https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/issues/673#note_389910
#   NOTE: As of kernel 5.5 the freezes should be fixed, but I'm keeping these
#   flags for the linux kernel (not linux-hardened) in case they are still
#   needed.
#
# - debugfs: enables debugfs [1][2] (which mounts /sys/kernel/debug), which is
#   needed to tweak CPU scheduler params as done by cfs-zen-tweaks [3]
