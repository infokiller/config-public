Type=simple
# NOTE: This used not to work because it complained about a permission error
# when calling os.setpgrp(), but as of 2020-08-10 it works when running from an
# activitywatch release.
# I can reproduce this issue with:
# systemd-run --user --pty --wait python -c 'import os; os.setpgrp()'
# The problem is described in [1] but the solution doesn't work for me, though
# running it from a python wrapper does. This issue should be solved in v0.12.0
# following [2].
