# Sometimes chromium will output many warnings or errors, which floods the
# ~/.xsession-error file. To filter out these errors, run chromium as following:
#
#   chromium <args> 2> >(grep -v <filtered_error_regex> 1>&2)
#
# For reference, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/15936384/1014208
#
# Filtered out errors:
# - As of 2018-09-26 Chrome outputs many errors on zeus18 from
#   gles2_cmd_decoder. As of 2020-07-26, these errors are not reproducible, so
#   their filtering is disabled.
