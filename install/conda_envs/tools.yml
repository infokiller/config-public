  # jupyter_contrib_nbextensions and jupyter_contrib_nbextensions only work in
  # the classic Notebook, not JupyterLab [1][2].  However, they are still needed
  # to avoid errors in JupyterLab, because both notebook frontends share a
  # config file jupyter_notebook_config.json that specifies to load these
  # extensions.

  # As of 2020-05-09, jupyter_contrib_nbextensions caused update errors in
  # zeus18, and I needed to reinstall the environment to work around that.
